<p>Graduated from Ecole Centrale Paris with a major in Applied Mathematics, machine learning is my second passion after trekking and travelling.  When I am not on the trails Iâ€™m working hard to find the hidden meaning behind the data. Convinced that statistical innovation is largely under used in industrial sector, I co-founded Buildata to answer that challenge. I apply latest innovation in Big Data to address tangible problems of our clients.</p>
