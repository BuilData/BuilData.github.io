BuilData was born during visits on ambitious construction projects around France and Asia. Even though making people aware of the industrial potential of Machine Learning is not the easiest task, I believe it’s once you’ve stepped away from your comfort zone that you realize it wasn’t all that great.
The path we take sure is hard, but it feels like the right one.</p>

     <h2>Why We're Here</h2>
      <p> We believe that you can't replace human intelligence. But you can empower it. </p>
      <p> When we started, we saw data that had yet to release its potential insight. We saw people facing operating problems, with an existing technology that failed to adapt to new challenges, and custom systems that took too long to deploy, let alone provide results.</p>
      <p> We want to solve complex real-world problems, in places that matter. We knew it would take a new approach and a new team.</p>
      <p> That's why we founded BuilData.</p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p> We are engineers: we want to build things that solve problems. </p>
    <p> Even though our team has deep academic knowledge, the expertise we have in data science, big data processing, distributed system infrastructure and user experience design is practical. </p>
    <p> We approach each mission with a problem-solving mindset that aims at producing operational results. </p>

    <h2>How We Work</h2>
    <p> During our missions, we interact with people coming from various different backgrounds: from your decision makers, IT and Research departments to the field-workers. </p>
    <p> Our world is complex and we are passionate about it, touching on data and computer science, UI design and distributed systems. It could be easy for us to tunnel-vision on designing a software that would make it to the top of the news tech section.</p>
    <p> Working directly with your people allows us to stay focused on the task at hand: making changes whose impacts can be measured durably on the field. Everyday. </p>
