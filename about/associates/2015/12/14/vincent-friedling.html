<p>Attracted by the elegant solutions that math and computer science have to offer to the complex problems surrounding us, i graduated from Ecole Centrale Paris with a master in Applied Mathematics. During my studies i was able to work for a year in Middle East and Africa as an aid worker. From that experience i kept a passion for travels and unique way to look at things. I am strongly convinced that, in years to come, mastering data will change the way we make decisions in our every-day life as in our professional life.</p>
